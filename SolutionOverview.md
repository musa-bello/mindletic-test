# Design principles

For this task, I tried as much as I can to adhere to a minimalistic design to keep the UI simple and clean without over complicating things. I maintained a visual hierarchy of information being presented on the UI, ensured my layout was consistent. Also just as the brief required, I made sure to provide adequate responses on the UI to the user for activity as they unfold. Lastly, I tried my best to maintain balance between functionality and aesthetics.
